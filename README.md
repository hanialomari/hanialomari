## Hi, I'm Hani 👋

I build retrieval that understands **images, text, video, and sound** — not just the literal match.

I'm a Ph.D. researcher at Virginia Tech working on **vision–language models (VLMs)**, **RAG**, and **ranking** systems. I use **multi-prompt embeddings** (many small “views” of meaning) so search results stay rich and fair.

- **What I do:** multi-prompt embeddings, two-stage **ranking → reranking**, and **RAG** with a VLM “reader.”
- **Why it matters:** Because the world tells richer stories when you let modalities talk to each other. I design retrieval pipelines that surface the surprising connections—like and have better matches for idioms, metaphor, culture, and context — not only the obvious hit.
- **Now:** training a VLM-based retriever + **cross-modal reranker**; building a **RAG** pipeline that plugs these into a simple API; exploring room-acoustic signals (RIRs) for spatial cues.
- **Why now?** We live in a semantically diverse era where creativity, safety, and accessibility depend on bridging visual, textual, and auditory understanding. Multimodal systems must retrieve more than the “closest” item—they must retrieve what matters.


### Projects (quick view)
- **Multi-Prompt Embedding for Retrieval** — one image/text ⇒ multiple focused embeddings; improves recall and reduces length/bias collapse.
- **RAG + Reranker for Multimodal Search** — lightweight retriever, VLM “reader,” and cross-encoder **reranker** for better final results.
- **Diversity-Aware VLM Retrieval** — surfaces literal, figurative, emotional, abstract, and background views instead of a single “one-size” vector.

**Open to:** collaborative projects on diversity-aware retrieval, interpretable vision-language models, or new evaluation benchmarks for multimodal reasoning, let’s talk. I’m excited about building the tools that help us navigate meaning across modalities with empathy and precision.
